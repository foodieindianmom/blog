<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Do Not add red chili powder, black pepper powder and turmeric powder in the curry to maintain the green colour of gravy.If you want to make spicy gravy then add  spicy green chili paste  while cooking gravy.
{: .blog-post-para}

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> To increase the creaminess add every ingredient in fine paste form like onion paste, dry spices paste etc and add lots of cream in the gravy.
{: .blog-post-para}

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Don't cook any  spinach gravy (Palak Paneer) in iron kadhai or vessels because iron in kadhai reacts with spinach and tomatoes in kadhai and makes the colour of gravy dark greenish black ,which does not look appealing. Cook this palak paneer in nonstick or stainless steel utensils.

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Many people used to give tadka of chopped garlic and dry red chillies in the prepared Palak paneer .If you want to add tadka ,you can add it otherwise it's not necessary. It depends on person to person taste palette , Some people prefer to eat more garlic than others. Because palak paneer gravy already contains garlic in it.
