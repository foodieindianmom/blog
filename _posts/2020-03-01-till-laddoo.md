    <ol class="text-justify" style="line-height: 200%">
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Wash the til and spread it on any cotton cloth and keep this in the sun for  6-7 hours , one day before making laddoo.when to get dry keep it aside in any air tight container.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Next Day, take a wide Kadhai and dry roast the till,  once its color changes to very light brown in colour. While roasting, continuously stir the spatula in a kadhai so that it doesn't get burned.<br>
        <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> When the till gets easily  mashed  between your fingers, this is the indication that it is properly roasted.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Keep the roasted till in a plate and keep it aside and let it cool  at room temperature.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px;">In the same kadhai add 1 cup of water and add jaggery in it. When the jaggery melts in water,allowed it to boil more and get thickens to a certain point.At that certain point ,add roasted Til and Mix well both the ingredients.Now the mixture of Til and Gur is ready.
                        <br><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>  To know at what point of time we have to add til in jaggery<br>
                        &bull; Take a cup of Water and put the drops of Thicken Jaggery in it. If this drop of Jaggery settles down in the bottom without mixing in water then this point, you should mix Til in Jaggery.<br>
                        &bull; If  the drop of Jaggery dissolves in water, then Jaggery and water mixture needs more Boiling and thickening.
                        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Apply ghee on your hands and start rolling laddoo immediately when this mixture is hot as when Gur / Jaggery cooled down, it becomes hard to roll them as laddoos.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Make a small same size laddoo from this mixture.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Grease the thali with ghee and then place laddoo on it. Then laddoo will not stick to the Thali. After some time store these laddoo in airtight container.</li>
