Gun Powder is a taste enhancer which enhances the taste of any food item served with it. It is also called Milagai Podi or Malaga Podi or Idli podi or Chutney Podi. The gunpowder got its name because of the use of a lot of dry red chilies which increase the hotness and spiciness in spicy powdered mix. Gunpowder is so spicy that it creates a feeling of explosion in the mouth with a burst of different flavours.

Gunpowder enhances the taste of Idli, Dosa, ghee rice etc. Many people in South india apply this gunpowder inside the dosa or they will fry button idlis in ghee, mustard seeds, curry leaves and then sprinkle this gunpowder on ghee fried idlis. Some people eat this gunpowder with ghee rice  and some use it to mix this gunpowder ( by making it more fine) while making curries or Poriyal.

Here in this blog I used a simple method of making Gunpowder that involves  two main processes that is Roasting and Grinding. Roast all the ingredients and then grind it. I have used sesame seeds in making this gunpowder but you can also use roasted peanuts(without skin) also, instead of sesame seeds. Both the ways gunpowder tastes Wow!!

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> You can sun dry each of the ingredients except turmeric powder and hing for at least 2 hours . After the sun dry you can dry roast the ingredients and then grind it. You can skip the sun drying process also. Sun dry process only ensures that masala prepared after grinding can last longer.

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Don't roast the ingredients for a long time because roasting ingredients for a longer time can cause loss of flavours and aromas from ingredients.
