Meat from a young goat is called lamb. In almost all parts of India, Mutton means the meat of the goat. Lamb Chops are the most expensive cuts of lamb, but are incredibly delicious and tender. Lucknow is famous for its non-vegetarian delicacies, some of which are quite simple to make and some can be quite complex. Mutton Curry is a perfect blend of different aromatic spices and tender juicy meat.

Mutton curry is usually served hot with Rumali Roti or Naan or tandoori Roti and Jeera Rice. The tari / Rasa / Gravy of Mutton Curry can be made according to individual choice. Some people preferred thick gravy while others preferred thin gravy.
