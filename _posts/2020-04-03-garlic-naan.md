Naan is the most popular flatbread in India. The soft, fluffy and chewy texture of naan make it more lovable for food lovers. It is mostly served with Curries either vegetarian or non-vegetarian.

In this recipe we are using Yeast to prepare this garlic butter naan. This naan can also be prepared without using yeast. Many restaurants use Baking powder and baking soda to prepare this garlic butter naan (without yeast).

If we are making Naan using Yeast then the whole process of making Naan takes time because in this process dough takes time to get double in size and then cook. If we are preparing Naan without Yeast that is with the help of Baking powder and Baking soda, then we can make naan immediately after making dough.

There are a variety of most popular flatbreads in India like simple Tawa naan, Butter naan, pudina naan, Onion Naan, Cheese stuffed Naan, Kulcha, garlic naan, Pita bread and Sheermal. Many people in India, especially in North India, prefer to eat Naan with any spicy gravy like Mutton Nihari. Usually Naan is served at lunch and Dinner in various restaurants.

These naans can be cooked either on Tawa, Oven, Tandoor, Pizza stone, soapstone tawa or cast iron tawa. Traditionally Naan is made of all purpose flour that is Maida, but nowadays on the account of health factors, it is also made up of Wheat flour but the taste and texture of  Naan made up of Maida is far better than wheat flour Naan.

Because of adding Yogurt in this naan recipe, Naan becomes soft, spongy and fluffy. The thickness of various Naan is different and also depends on the likings of the individual person. Also the cooking style of each Naan recipe is different from the other.

In this recipe I use Kalonji / Onion seeds, Butter, fine chopped Garlic and chopped coriander leaves as toppings for this naan. This homemade  Garlic butter naan is prepared on iron Tawa. Texture and taste of this tawa naan is the same as naan prepared on Tandoor.

As a foodie I love to eat these Naan with any mutton gravy dish. In my Childhood days my Mom usually prepared these Naan when we came back from school. I learned to cook this Garlic Butter naan recipe from my mother. She makes dal tadka and mutton gravy with this naan.

##### **Recipe Steps** {#recipe}
1. Take a tadka pan and warm ¼ cup water in it. Add 1 tsp Yeast and 2 tbsp Sugar in warm water. Set it aside to activate. When the bubbles start appearing in the mixture, the mixture is activated.
1. Take a large mixing bowl and add maida in it. Now add a mixture of Yeast, water and sugar prepared in the previous step.
1. Now add Yoghurt, milk, oil and salt to taste in a mixing bowl.
1. Mix all ingredients well to make a soft dough.
1. Rub some oil on the dough so that the crust of the dough does not get dry.
1. Cover the mixing bowl with a plate and keep it aside at rest in some warm place at least for half an hour.
1. After half an hour, when dough size become double, it is ready to cook either on iron  Tawa, cast iron tawa, tandoor, or Oven
1. Divide the dough into equal parts and start rolling down the dough balls on Chakla or Rolling board and flattened into thick rotis or Naan.
1. Sprinkle fine chopped garlic, chopped coriander leaves and kalonji seeds on thick rotis and again roll gently with the help of a rolling pin on it so that all garlic and kalonji seeds get well inserted inside the thick rotis.
1. Prepare 5-6 naan and keep it aside on plate.
1. Heat the iron tawa (instead of using non-stick tawa, use iron tawa so that rotis does not get easily stuck on it).
1. Brush water on the back side of thick rotis and put that (water coated side) thick roti on iron tawa. Because of water, Roti gets stuck on tawa. Now flip and heat up tawa on both sides directly on the gas flame so that both sides of the rotis get well cooked.
1. Now Garlic naan is ready and applies lots of butter on this Garlic naan and serves hot with any vegetarian or non-vegetarian curry.
1. Taste and texture of this garlic butter naan cooked on tawa is the same as cooked in tandoor.
1. You can also bake these naan in a preheated oven at 180 C for 10-12 minutes.

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Traditionally Naan is prepared by using hands, but it requires lots of practice. Nowadays rolling pins and rolling boards are used to make Naan. Do not dust extra flour while rolling dough balls on a rolling board because extra flour (Parthan) makes Naan hard.
