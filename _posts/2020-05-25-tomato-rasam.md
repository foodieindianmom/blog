Rasam is a spicy and tangy lentil and tamarind based broth, usually prepared in Lunch and Dinner. It is served as a side dish in any southindian thali. Traditionally Rasam is made using Tamarind or kokum and black pepper. But in changing times, Rasam is cooked with or without using Tamarind. South India is considered as land of spices, so these spices and herbs such as tamarind, blackpepper, curry leaves, star anise, cloves etc are abundantly found in South India.

Many People in South India completely get their rice with rasam and then they eat their rice.
