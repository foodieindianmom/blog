Rasam is a spicy and tangy lentil and tamarind based broth, usually prepared in Lunch and Dinner. It is served as a side dish in any southindian thali. Traditionally Rasam is made using Tamarind or kokum and black pepper. But in changing times, Rasam is cooked with or without using Tamarind. South India is considered as land of spices, so these spices and herbs such as tamarind, blackpepper, curry leaves, star anise, cloves etc are abundantly found in South India. So People of south India usually prepare their dishes with the help of naturally grown vegetables, spices and herbs. Many People in South India completely get their rice with rasam and then they eat their rice. On the other hand many people drink Rasam Straight because of the watery and soupy nature of spicy and tangy Rasam. Rasam has many health benefits also like it helps in digestion, it can cure cough and cold, it can cure  headaches, it improves the immunity and metabolism of the body and helps in weight loss etc.
