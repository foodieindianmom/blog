Amritsari chola is the traditional authentic Punjabi dish which is prepared by using Kabuli chana , ginger garlic masalas and a variety of indian spices. This punjabi style amritsari chola is different in colour and flavour of regular Kabuli chola gravy. Amritsari chola is dark in colour because of using tea powder or tea bags while boiling Kabuli Chole.

This traditional Amritsari chola recipe originated in Punjab, a state in North India. But now Amritsari chola is quite popular in India and abroad.Many eateries from highway Dhaba to 5 star Restaurants ,all of them serve this dish with Naan specially Garlic  Butter Naan, Tandoori Roti, Kulcha either plain or stuffed and Jeera rice.

Many people sell aloo tikki chaat with Amritsari chole and garnish with spicy and tangy Green chutney and sweet imli khajoor red chutneys. Many other chaat walas sell chaat like Samosa chaat, Karela Chaat etc along with Amritsari chole. I love to eat Amritsari Chole with Pudina Butter naan. Everyone has their own liking  and disliking about their food combinations like some people simply love to eat Amritsari chole with Rice and others can prefer amritsari chola with Naan and kulcha.

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> You can use Regular Tea bags (Not Green tea) (if you have tea bags at time of cooking ) instead of using tea powder.
{: .blog-post-para}

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Use Organic Kabuli Chana instead of regular kabuli chana while preparing this dish because organic kabuli chana get soft easily after boiling as compared to regular kabuli chana.
{: .blog-post-para}

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Use all the ingredients in the fresh form, either onion paste or ginger garlic paste ,tomato puree etc. Do not use preservatives containing masala paste and canned puree. You will automatically acknowledge the difference in taste when we are using everything fresh and when we are using ready to cook paste and puree.
