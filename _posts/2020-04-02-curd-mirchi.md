{: .blog-post-steps}

##### **Recipe Steps** {#recipe}
1. Wash and dry each green chilli and keep it in a Big plate or Paraath so that there is space between each chilli.
1. Prepare a mixture of Carom seeds, Coriander seeds and Salt in a mixer and keep it aside in a bowl. This is the stuffing masala of green chillies.
1. Make a slit in each green chilli and insert the stuffing masala in each of them and keep it aside in a big plate or parath. Do Not remove the stalk (Dhanthal) of green chilli while making a slit.
1. In a mixing Bowl add curd/ yoghurt and 1.5 cup of water to it . Blend this curd and water with the help of a hand or electric blender. Now add leftover stuffing masala  in curd water mixture.(If there is no stuffing masala left then dont take tension as adding leftover stuffing masala is optional).
1. Dip each Stuffed chilli into the curd. Let the chillies dipped in curd for 2 days. After the 1st day you stir the  stuffed green chilies dipped in curd.Now flavour of curd is well absorbed in the stuffed green chillies.
1. After 2 days, lay down all the  stuffed green chillies either on any thin cloth( like Saree or Dupatta) or big parath and keep it in sunlight by covering these chillies again with any thin cloth  so that air and light can easily reach inside the Parath.
1. After 3 days of drying in sunlight, all green chillies get completely Dry. Keep all dry chillies in an airtight container.
1. Whenever you want to eat something spicy, fry these stuffed green chillies and enjoy your meal.
