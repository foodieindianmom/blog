Aloo Matar Poha is a simple, easy to make, quick breakfast made with flattened Rice, Peanuts, Onions, different Spices, Potatoes and Green peas. This snack recipe is quite popular across India and the cooking style of making this Poha is almost the same in different parts of India. Poha is the Indian dish widely prepared in the Indian States of Maharashtra, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Telangana and many other regions of India.

Poha is a staple breakfast particularly in Northern, Central and Western India as it is easy to cook and ingredients are readily available.

Poha is made by using either Red Poha or White Poha. Poha is easily available in a grocery shop and is basically flat, light fluffy dry flakes of rice. The thickness of Poha ranges from thin, medium and thick. In this recipe I have used medium range Poha. Poha when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, absorb that liquid very easily and quickly. It is important to use less oil while cooking Aloo Poha, so that Poha does not get oily and sticky and the end result looks shiny and bright.
