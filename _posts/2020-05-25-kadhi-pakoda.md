Kadhi is usually served  with plain  steam rice. Many people prefer to eat ghee rice with kadhi. Pulao, khichdi is also eaten with kadhi in some places in India like West Bengal, Bihar. Many people in India used to give tadka of fine chopped onions and green chillies in kadhi.

Dry mix all ingredients .Then add warm water in the dry mix and do whisking of batter in one direction .Due to beating of batter in one direction ,air trapped in batter is responsible for making soft pakora for kadhi. After Whisking , the batter should have a creamy texture with no lumps. Batter should be of medium consistency, neither thick nor runny.
1. Heat oil in a kadhai . Just  Before making pakora , add 2 tsp hot oil from kadhai  and add  this to the batter. (Adding oil in batter helps in getting moist pakora and pakora will remain moist for a long time) . Mix well in one direction .Then  start pouring small portions from batter called pakora in oil. When the pakora gets fried ,transfer all the pakora  to a plate and let it cool at room temperature.
1. Take another Mixing Bowl and add ½ cup Besan/ Gram Flour In it. Add ¾ cup Sour curd in the mixing bowl. Mix Well. Add  1 tsp red chili powder, 1  tsp turmeric Powder, 1 tsp coriander Powder and salt to taste in mixing bowl.Mix well. Add 3 cups of water in a mixing bowl. Mix it well with no lumps with the help of an electric blender or hand blender.This is a Besan Curd water mixture.
1. Add 1.5 tbsp oil in a kadhai. Add hing, mustard seeds, Cumin Seeds, dry red chillies,curry leaves in the oil. When Mustard seeds, Cumin seeds and curry leaves start to sputter then immediately add Besan curd water mixture.Mix it Well. Let the Water and gram flour mixture come to a boil. Then add Pakora in kadhi . Let the kadhi cook for 12-14 minutes on low to medium flame . After 14 minutes kadhi starts thickening, then switches off the gas and covers the kadhai with a lid.
