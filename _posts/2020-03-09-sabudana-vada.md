Sabudana Vada is an excellent option when you are fasting. In India this filling and nutritious snack is usually served during religious festivals and during fast/ vrat / upvas especially during Navratri vrats. As per Hindu beliefs food that is taken during the fast should not contain Onions, garlic, pulses, or wheat flour. Like all Vada these are best eaten fresh.
