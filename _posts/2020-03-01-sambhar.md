<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> In case Sambhar is coming out as a bit runny, balance the consistency by adding a few spoons of rice flour and water mixture into the Sambhar to thicken it.

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> If your sambhar becomes more tangy then you can reduce the tanginess by adding a small piece of jaggery in Sambhar while cooking.
